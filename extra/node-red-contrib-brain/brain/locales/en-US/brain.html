<p>The node can train robot through the use of neural networks, in order to make the robot have the ability to self-learning.</p>
<h4 id="Configuration parameters"><a name="Configuration parameters" href="#Configuration parameters"></a>Configuration parameters</h4>
<ol>
<li>name：The node name</li>
<li>brainType： It has two types, training and running, training will produce neural network data.</li>
<li>learningRate：The number of the updated wights.</li>
<li>hiddenLayers：The hidden layers which defines neural network.This is a list of positive integer, 1 for each hidden layer.Separated by commas.</li>
<li>errorThresh：</li>
<li>iterations：The training iterations, if the set is non-zero then the network can be terminated earlier.</li>
<li>logPeriod：The time required for one iteration in milliseconds.</li>
